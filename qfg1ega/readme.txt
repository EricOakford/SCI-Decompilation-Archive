### Quest for Glory I EGA (QFG1EGA)
  Game version 1.200
  
  Interpreter version 0.000.629

In rm084, the Antwerp keeps bouncing to the lower-left part of the screen, stopped only by the mountainous terrain. Fortunately, it can still be scared off.

Despite this issue, I was able to complete the game and export my character for QFG2.
