### Quest for Glory I VGA (QFG1VGA)
  Game version 2.000
  
  Interpreter version L.rry.021

The game's 999.voc is out of date. A newer one has been included, and contains all the kernel functions the interpreter supports, including AssertPalette (which was kernel_128, used frequently in this game).

Ready for another go.
