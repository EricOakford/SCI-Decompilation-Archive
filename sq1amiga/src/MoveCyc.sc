;;;;	Cycles thru and repositions cels of a prop or actor
;;;;
;;;;	Our artists gave us many cast lists that had each point of an
;;;;	animation sequence mapped out exactly.  This just makes it easier
;;;;	to handle the array of points to 'move' to.
;;;;
;;;;	Usage:
;;;;		(aProp setCycle:	MoveCycle APATH optionalCaller)
;;;;
;;;;		aProp can also be an actor if you're so inclined.
;;;;		APATH is the address of a local array that hold the points.
;;;;		optionalCaller is, as usual, an optional caller.
;;;;
;;;;	Setting up points:
;;;;		(define APATH loop cel x y loop cel x y ...)
;;;;
;;;;		having loop & cel in list allows more flexibility in case cels of
;;;;		movement are in more than one loop.
;;;;
;;;;	Modified 10/20/90 so as to use clients cycleSpeed.
;;;;    Added size property to allow use of its own cycleDir.
;;;;		J.M.H.
;;;;
;;;;	Classes:
;;;;	  MoveCycle
