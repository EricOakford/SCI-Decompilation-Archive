(class Extra of Prop
	;;; The behavior of an Extra is to wait for a random interval of time,
	;;; cycle for a while, then wait for another random period before doing
	;;; it over again.
	;;;
	;;; Pablo's extensions:
	;;; The above is true if cycleType is ExtraForward. If it is ExtraEndLoop 
	;;; then the pauseCel is a cel where we pause for "hesitation" cycles. If 
	;;; it is ExtraEndAndBeginLoop then the pause is between the end and begin 
	;;; loops.
